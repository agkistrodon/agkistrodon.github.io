<b>Project Overview</b>: I created an AI Yoda bot by combining my passions for crocheting and engineering. The bot runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (a miniature computer). 
Inside the crochet shell is housed the Raspberry Pi, a microphone, and a speaker. Input from the microphone is transcribed and used as a prompt to OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, and the 
output is read aloud by an Azure Cognitive Services text-to-speech service through the speaker, mimicking Yoda in both content and voice.

<b>Sample Conversation</b>:
<p><b>Me</b>: Yoda, say hello to everyone reading this!</p>
<p><b>Yoda</b>: Hello to you all, I say. Strong with knowledge, you are. Keep learning, you must. May the Force be with you always. Yes, hm.</p>
