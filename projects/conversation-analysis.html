<b>Project Overview</b>: In group projects or collaborations, having awareness of how different members contribute to the conversation and fostering 
an environment where everyone can add to the conversation equally has been shown to have a significant impact on group performance. This project focuses 
on building a web app to keep track of different speakers and visualize their contributions to the conversation. This includes keeping track of the amplitude
of speech, how often people interrupt others, and other metrics of how a conversation is going.
