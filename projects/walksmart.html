<h2>Abstract</h2>

Ambulatory fall incidents – which denote unanticipated falls during normal walking – are well known to be
a leading cause of injury and injury-related deaths, especially
in the elderly and in those with neurological disorders. Every
year, one in four older adults experiences a fall, and every 11
seconds, someone is treated in an emergency department for an
ambulatory fall-related injury. In this work, we aim to mitigate
ambulatory falls by using smartphones to detect and alert people
when their risk of falling increases. We propose WalkSmart –
a new machine learning-based technique for ambulatory fall
prevention based on analyzing gait variance using sensor data
collected using smartphones. WalkSmart runs as a smartphone
app and interacts with our cloud-based machine learning model
to detect and alert people of impending falls, thereby potentially
saving lives.

<br><br>
WalkSmart uses a new machine learning model for classifying
gait patterns as steady or unsteady, using a long short-term
memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network as its basis.
WalkSmart was trained using hours of real-world walking data
collected using smartphones. Experiments show that it can
effectively infer unsteady gait with a high accuracy of 96.6%,
using a small window of accelerometer and gyroscope sensor
data captured by a smartphone.
