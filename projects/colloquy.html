Description: Colloquy is a large-language-model based Android app intended to help anyone who has trouble articulating themselves, 
and is particularly geared towards those who cannot speak. With Colloquy, users can record one side of a conversation. Using optional 
inputted context about the userâ€™s thoughts on the topic at hand as well as the aforementioned recording, Colloquy uses a large-language-model 
to come up with eloquent and apt responses that the user can choose from. The selected response can then be read aloud using its text-to-speech
feature or echoed by the user. In this way, Colloquy makes articulation easy.
