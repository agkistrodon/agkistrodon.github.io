<b>Description</b>: Colloquy is a large-language-model based Android app intended to help anyone who has trouble hearing or otherwise articulating themselves (for example, due to a language barrier or speech impediment), 
conduct day-to-day conversations. 
<br />
With Colloquy, users can record one side of a conversation. Using optional, a priori inputted context about the userâ€™s thoughts on the topic at hand as well as the aforementioned recording, Colloquy uses a large-language-model 
to come up with eloquent and apt responses that the user can choose from. The selected response can then be read aloud using its text-to-speech
feature or echoed by the user.
<br />
As an example, suppose the user enters a car dealership, wishing to discuss and bargain on potential car options. Before entering the dealership,
the user could provide context, including their ideal price range, features they would like the car to have, and/or any technical specs, as well
as their goals for the conversation.
<br />
During the conversation with the car dealer, Colloquy is used in real-time. It continuously records the conversation, listening and transcribing
the dealer's words for the user to read. Using the inputted context as well as the transcript, Colloquy references a large-language-model
to produce its responses, from which the user chooses one to say or for the app to read aloud.
