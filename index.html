<br />I am currently a junior at <a href="https://rhs.lwsd.org/">Redmond High School</a>. My interests
lie in the areas of AI and machine learning, and I specifically enjoy using these to solve societal challenges, data system designs, 
and scientific applications. I also love astronomy and am interested in applying data processing and machine learning ideas to
advance the field rapidly. I am currently a <a href="https://www.museumofflight.org/WAS">Washington Aerospace Scholar</a>,
a <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins Advanced CTY member</a>, the competitions coordinator for my high school
Science Olympiad club, and a member of the <a href="https://www.nhs.us/">National Honor Society</a>.

<br /><br />

I am passionate about building an interest in STEM among kids. I founded <a href="https://stemity.net/">Stemity</a>, a non profit through which I conduct 
STEM contests and workshops regularly. I have also worked as a summer counselor for <a href="https://girlsrockmath.org/">Girls Rock Math</a>.<br /><br />

When Iâ€™m not studying or doing research, I like to create digital art, create video games, write poems, and read books.
