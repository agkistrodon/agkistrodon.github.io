<br />I am currently a freshman at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>. My interests
lie in computer science, and I am currently looking at the areas of algorithms, data structures, AI, and ML. 
I enjoy using computer science to solve societal challenges, improve data system designs, and advance scientific 
fields. 

<br /><br />

I am a research intern at the <a href="https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/"> Ubiquitous Computing Lab at 
the University of Washington </a>, <a href="https://www.museumofflight.org/WAS">Washington Aerospace Scholar</a>,
a <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins Advanced CTY member</a>, the competitions coordinator for my high 
school Science Olympiad club, and a member of the <a href="https://www.nhs.us/">National Honor Society</a>.

<br /><br />

I am passionate about building an interest in STEM among kids. I founded <a href="https://stemity.net/">Stemity</a>, a non profit through which I conduct 
STEM contests and workshops regularly. I have also worked as a summer counselor for <a href="https://girlsrockmath.org/">Girls Rock Math</a>.<br /><br />

When Iâ€™m not studying or doing research, I like to create digital art, create video games, write poems, and read books.
