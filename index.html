<br />I am currently a junior at <a href="https://rhs.lwsd.org/">Redmond High School</a>. My interests
lie in computer science, and I am currently looking at the areas of algorithms, data structures, AI, and ML. 
I enjoy using computer science to solve societal challenges, improve data system designs, and advance scientific 
fields. I also love astronomy and am curious about applying data processing and machine learning ideas to advance
the field. I am currently a <a href="https://www.museumofflight.org/WAS">Washington Aerospace Scholar</a>,
a <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins Advanced CTY member</a>, the competitions coordinator for my high school Science Olympiad 
club, and a member of the <a href="https://www.nhs.us/">National Honor Society</a>.

<br /><br />

I am passionate about building an interest in STEM among kids. I founded <a href="https://stemity.net/">Stemity</a>, a non profit through which I conduct 
STEM contests and workshops regularly. I have also worked as a summer counselor for <a href="https://girlsrockmath.org/">Girls Rock Math</a>.<br /><br />

When Iâ€™m not studying or doing research, I like to create digital art, create video games, write poems, and read books.

    <i>August 2023:</i> I completed the eight weeks of my internship with UW's UbiComp Lab. I worked on a project focusing on conversation analysis through recordings of meetings, the result of which was a web app which provided various metrics (i.e., interruption frequency, sentiment analysis) on the conversation. I aim to continue working with the lab on this project going forward!
