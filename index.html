<br />I am currently a freshman studying computer science at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> and an incoming
Associate Software Development Intern at Google. I am interested in the areas of AI, cybersecurity, systems, and data visualization.  

<br /><br />

I am an undergraduate researcher with the Interactive Data Lab at the University of Washington. I am also a member of 
the <a href="https://huskysat.org/">Husky Satellite Lab</a>,
a Student Voices writer for the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/">Seattle Times</a>, and the Freshman Representative
for the <a href="https://www.wicys.org/">Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS)</a> Student Chapter at the University of Washington.
I am also a <a href="https://www.aspirations.org/">NCWIT Aspirations in Computing</a> National Honorable Mention designee 
as well as the NCWIT Seattle and Western Washington Affiliate Winner.

<br /><br />

I was formerly a research intern at the <a href="https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/">Ubiquitous Computing Lab</a> at 
the University of Washington, <a href="https://www.museumofflight.org/WAS">Washington Aerospace Scholar</a>,
a <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins Advanced CTY member</a>, the competitions coordinator for my high 
school Science Olympiad club, and a member of the <a href="https://www.nhs.us/">National Honor Society</a>.

<br /><br />

I am passionate about building an interest in STEM among kids. I founded <a href="https://stemity.net/">Stemity</a>, a non profit through which I conduct 
STEM contests and workshops regularly. I have also worked as a summer counselor for <a href="https://girlsrockmath.org/">Girls Rock Math</a>.<br /><br />

In my spare time, I like to create digital art, develop video games, and read books!
