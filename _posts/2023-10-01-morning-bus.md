Music swims through my ears, the acoustic notes of Harrison Storm’s “Be Slow” tuning out the world around me. I had never done anything else on the bus; just leaned my head against the bus pole, closed my eyes, and let the half hour fly by until I heard the distinctive voice informing me I had reached my stop. Three weeks of the same monotony, and I was used to it; it was almost subconscious the way I entered and exited with the twentyish other passengers that made the same commute every weekday morning.

That would have also been the case today, because the subconscious me, who had been staring out the grimy window, not truly seeing the boats docked on the edge of Lake Washington, hadn’t noticed that half an hour had already passed. It was only when the woman sitting next to me glanced nervously at her watch, then uttered a question to the passengers sitting solitarily and silently in the back of the bus: “Does anyone know when we’ll reach?”

“Nine thirty,” I responded almost automatically, because that was what made sense, after all; but a look at my own watch let me know that the time was nearing ten o’clock. 

“I have a meeting at ten,” another passenger, who had been frantically typing on his computer throughout the ride, spoke up.

The man sleeping on the row of seats at the back of the bus stirred from his slumber and peered blearily at the odd group now participating in an awkwardly framed discourse: people from all ages, ranging from me at 16 to this man himself, who revealed that he was a grandfather visiting his granddaughter at the University of Washington.

“We’re barely moving,” the woman next to me mumbles, her eyes trained on the traffic, all trying to cross the 520 bridge, bottlenecked at the construction on the offramp. My eyes moved from her, to the man on his computer, to the student who’d only recently moved to Washington state from China to pursue graduate study, to the grandfather who was now sitting upright, texting someone, presumably his granddaughter. All of them were people I had tuned out every day, even though we sat together at the back of the bus to Seattle every morning.

It’s with a smile that I stow my headphones in my bag and stop watching the minutes tick by on my phone, and instead turn to the group.

“Are we all headed to UW?”

The collective nods, followed by laughter at our simultaneity, answer the question for me. Bonded in an uncertain experience, each of us with deadlines to meet or events to attend, five people sat in the back of a bus, having met before but meeting for the first time.

In each of the experiences I had since on this very bus: stranded on the side of the highway as mechanics tried desperately to figure out what was wrong with the engine, or fearfully watching a masked man make off with two bikes that weren’t his, I felt the same sense of solidarity with people whom I’d never met, a community whom I’d never known, tied simply by the fact that we were in the same place at the same time. The feeling of sonder, as it slowly blossomed each and every day, resonated throughout each experience, a common thread making clear what I had subconsciously known all along, that each and every one of us, from the man who was willing to steal a beat up bike for a little money to the grandfather who had lived through two wars and came out aged but wiser, have our own stories, and our own lives.

Although our paths may never cross again, I still reflect upon this experience every time I’m asked to share my story. It was a moment of realization, almost, that my thoughts on each experience are shaped by the people around me, which mold together to make me who I am. My story is my own, but it consists of moments like these, in which the main players are feelings of curiosity, awakening, friendship, and the inexplicable force that brought five strangers into a public bus on a Monday morning and let all five go ever so slightly wiser.
