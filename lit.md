dear diary

dear diary
if a tree falls in a forest
and there’s no one around to hear it
would it still make a sound?
or would it just be silent
it seems so obvious
it seems so scientific

The words glared back
from the ink-smudged page
as slowly and carefully
they were erased
and she tried again.

dear diary
what’s the difference between alone and lonely?
i'm not quite sure i understand yet
neither of them should apply to me
and yet
maybe

She watched her fingers move
but didn’t finish the sentence.
It was fruitless, it was nothing more
than childish pretense
and she tried again.

dear diary
there’s really nothing much to say
today was pretty nice;
similar to yesterday
i hung out with my friends
we played a little game

She reread the lines in silence.
It was perfect, they were so real.
But if she was being honest,
it was more surreal
but that didn’t matter, as always.

dear diary

She paused
staring at the blank page
then began to write
in a fit of rage.

what’s the point in lying?
who am i meaning to deceive?
i was given this voice, but i'm not even trying
to tell my own story
we’re all so good at listening
but when it comes time to speak
“she has it worse so stop complaining”
is what they all tell me
i asked you earlier, before erasing

what’s the difference between alone and lonely
is this feeling
the answer, dear diary?

She stared in horror because the words she’d written
hit so close to the truth
but finally she stood up straight
and exited the room
because if they wouldn’t listen
she’d just force them to.

Elsewhere a tree fell
in this urban forest
and everyone
was around to hear it.

I wrote this poem on the topic of "Show Your Voice":

```
The Piano Man’s Symphony

The streets were always filled with music
Thanks to the piano man
Who’d spend his days and nights outside
His instrument in hand

The people all would know him,
But then again that wasn’t quite true
They’d know of him, yes, 
But not who he was, or what he could do

Until that one midwinters day
When the snow was falling down
And the streets were cold and dark and silent
Because the piano man wasn’t around

His piano, though, was still there,
Set up on the corner
And people glanced with curiosity,
But never stopped to wonder

Until a young girl, no older than four
Walked up to the bench and sat down
And though she’d never played before
Began to compose a song

And although her notes were slightly off
Her tempo not quite right
When the piano man came at last
He couldn’t help but cry

He told her that day, his voice aquiver
In between her beats
That the world had taught him how to listen
But never how to speak

He wished the people would stop by
Give him a few moments to spare
But, he asked her, what was the point
if no one cared to care?

She stood up then, and said to him
“I’ll hear what you have to say.
I’ll be your audience;
I’m horrible at piano, anyway.”

Immediately his face broke into a smile
For the first time that day
As he began to play and sing the lyrics
Of the story he’d always wanted to say

And a crowd began to gather
First one, then two, then three
And slowly the whole town had heard
The piano man’s symphony

My poem "This Is How You Change a World" won the district Award of Excellence at Reflections 2022:

```
This Is How You Change a World

They say it’s like a series of ripples
Fluttering across a still lake
Each one sparks more and more
Until all the water begins to shake
But even those ripples, eventually fade
And the former tranquility is regained

They say it’s like a single act
A clash of evil on light
Until, in the end, the good triumphs
But not everything is so black and white
And when the lines, they start to blur
It’s hard to tell what’s wrong and right

They say it’s like a closed door
Behind which lies an opportunity
And all you need is the courage to open it
And let your dreams flow free
Yet every life has ups and downs
And nothing ever comes so easily

Instead, it’s like a burning flame
The kind that glows a flickering gold
That can unhesitatingly provide warmth
To those stranded out in the cold
That sees behind the initial front
And extends a hand for them to hold

It doesn’t have to cause a ripple
It may not ever influence the long run
A single act of kindness can go a long way
Because in the end, we’re all human
And though it may not change the world
A world will change for someone

My poem "Face of the Future" won the district Award of Excellence at Reflections 2021:

```
Face of the Future

It was nearly fourteen billion years ago
When the universe first formed
And a series of lucky events
Soon followed

Around ten billion years later
Earth formed with gas and dust
Violent, dangerous, and uninhabitable
Volcanoes marring its crust

Life began some years later
In the form of small cyanobacteria
They set the stage for all of life
To come in the following millennia

It took decades from sponges to dinosaurs
With mass extinctions in between
Until around five million years ago
Humans began to convene

At first, we were primitive
Foraging without a blink
Until the cognitive revolution came around
And we began to think

All the dominant species before us
Were wiped clean off the Earth

Now the future stands ahead
And it’s time to prove our worth

We matter because
We’re the next stage of life
It takes only one spark to start an inferno
And one ne’er-do-well to cause strife

I matter because

It takes only one person to inspire the rest
The world is now in all our hands
Our generation is put to the test

We matter because

Everyone working together can change the world
From the ashes of revolutions
New civilizations have unfurled

I matter because

Whether the act be miniscule or world-changing
Our generation is now the face of the future
And each one of us is contributing
```
