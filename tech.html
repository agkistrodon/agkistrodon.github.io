Title: #trashtag
<br>
I created this game in early 2022 as a way of encouraging people to clean up their local beaches.
<br>
Story: #trashtag: The viral social media challenge to clean up the environment, because let's be real, the environment needs cleaning. 
It's a world-changing act - one that not only makes the Earth a better place but also provides a better habitat for the other species 
that call this planet home. This game emulates the cleaning of a littered beach, in hopes that the player will go on to clean a real 
beach and change the real world. Read more <a href="https://www.trashtag.org/">here</a>.
